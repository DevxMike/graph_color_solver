The software is used to solve the problem of coloring the vertices of a graph. The simpleGA genetic algorithm is used to solve the problem. \

Usage:\
- compile the program on your platform,\
- prepare a text file that contains the number of vertex colors, the number of vertices and the connections between vertices.\
